# Analyzing Covid-19 data via Python/Jupyter

The underlying data is dynamically imported from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData 

# Purpose

The repository contains a Python/Jupyter notebook to import COVID-19 data, to enrich and visualize it.

The current code focuses on deriving the relative daily change (in percentage resp. change rate) as this number needs to be
minimized to prevent COVID-19 turning into more than a global nightmare.

The countries to be analyzed can be configured in the section "Adaptation". For some countries/regions the underlying data 
is further subdivided into provinces/states. The code does not yet support this decomposition and the respective countries.

together to fight COVID-19 - independent from where we come from.
